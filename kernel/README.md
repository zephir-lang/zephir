Zephir Kernel
==============

Zephir Kernel is a meta-framework on top of the Zend API helping to create PHP extensions in an easier way
for a PHP developer.

In order to build a fast and stable framework, we have created the Zephir Kernel. The use of
this API helps us to write C code in a PHP style. We have developed a number of functions to help the
programmer to write code more interoperable with PHP in a easier way.

Zephir Kernel API is based on the Zend API, but we have added more features to facilitate us the work.
Zephir is a very large project, frameworks need to be developed and improved every day, Zephir Kernel API
helps us to write C code that is more stable and familiar to PHP developers.

If you’re a PHP developer maybe you don’t know C or you don’t want to learn C, but after read this guide
you will find the Zephir API very familiar to your knowledge.

Zephir Kernel provides you:

* Manipulate arrays/objects
* Call functions/methods in the PHP userland
* Automatic memory management
* Require and execute PHP plain files
* Simplification of common operations like concatenation
* Read superglobals and update the active symbol table
